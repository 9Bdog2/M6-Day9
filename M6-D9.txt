Relational Vs Non Relational 

Embedding Vs Referencing 

Embedding 
Pros

Retrice all data with a single query
Avoid expensive joins 
Update all data with a single operation 

Cons

Large Docs => we send and retrive more data
16MB document limit
Duplication of data 

Referencing 

Pros

Smaller docs 
Don't reach 16 MB limit 
No Duplication of data 
Infrequently acced data not accesed on every query

Cons

Joins are slow 


To link or to embed ? // What are the needs of your application 

Relationships

1-to-1
1-to-many
many-to-many

Favor embedding unless there is a compelling reason not to 
Arrays should not grow without bound
When designing data models, always consider the application usage of the data
(i.e. queries, updates and processing of the data)

.populate({path : ""})
